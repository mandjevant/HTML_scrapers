ScholarScraper scrapes from http://www.scholar.google.com

Currently you can only use the scraper from editing the sh.py file. This is because the scrapers were originally made for a bigger project.
If help making different accessing method is desired, I invite you to open an issue.

Functions of this scraper include;
